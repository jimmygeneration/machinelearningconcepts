# machinelearningconcepts
This repository lays the foundational knowledge of machine learning. The scope of this notebook is to go over basic machine learning techniques and provide a general mathematical overview of how they work. This will not cover the latest and greatest, but may mention them for the sake of context and how these basic techniques can be used in a complex scenario. Most of the material here is based on Monash's Graduate level Master's course on Machine Learning, Christopher M. Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" and Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning (Standford).
